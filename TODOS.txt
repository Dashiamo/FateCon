Initial playable state:
    - Server side card position/flip state.
    - Show if card is hidden to other players on local view.
    - Hand system.
    - Counters.
    - Simple way to pick deck you want to play and load all those cards.

    - Probably more stuff goes here. 

Improvements:
    - Make sure cards keep on the grid on window resize.
    - Make first two people to join players and everyone else spectators.
    - Fix transparent corners on cards.
    - Basic game logic?
